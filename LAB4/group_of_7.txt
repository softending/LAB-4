"How is this?" said the Emperor to himself. "I can see nothing! This is indeed a terrible affair!
Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could
happen--Oh! the cloth is charming," said he, aloud. "It has my complete approbation." And he
smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say
that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue
now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no
more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, "Oh, how beautiful!" and advised his
majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching
procession. "Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!" resounded on all sides; and everyone was
uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors
with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of
"Gentlemen Weavers."

The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take
place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to
finish the Emperor's new suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with
their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. "See!" cried they, at last.
"The Emperor's new clothes are ready!"
And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues
raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, "Here are your Majesty's
trousers! Here is the scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one might
fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however, is the great virtue of this
delicate cloth."
