Paragraph 3 by puwadol
"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth," said the Emperor to
himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he
remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the
manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he
would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their
work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of
the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or
how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the Emperor at last, after some
deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no
one can be more suitable for his office than he is."

Paragraph 4 by puwadol
So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their
might, at their empty looms. "What can be the meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening
his eyes very wide. "I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did not
express his thoughts aloud.

The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms;
and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very
beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and
looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was
nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never
thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my
office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."

"How is this?" said the Emperor to himself. "I can see nothing! This is indeed a terrible affair!
Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could
happen--Oh! the cloth is charming," said he, aloud. "It has my complete approbation." And he
smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say
that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue
now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no
more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, "Oh, how beautiful!" and advised his
majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching
procession. "Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!" resounded on all sides; and everyone was
uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors
with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of
"Gentlemen Weavers."

The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take
place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to
finish the Emperor's new suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with
their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. "See!" cried they, at last.
"The Emperor's new clothes are ready!"
And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues
raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, "Here are your Majesty's
trousers! Here is the scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one might
fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however, is the great virtue of this
delicate cloth."
